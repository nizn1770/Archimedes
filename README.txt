Known bugs:
- key binds work in all windows
    - don't know that we need it in all
- can only get to feet by clicking delete to move backwards, clicking text box will highlight, but then text entry will go to previous active_entry
    - might be as simple as removing the feet all together

UI fixes:
- make text and textbox bigger
- make screen full screen on progress_window
- make cancel button bigger on progress_window
- make screen full screen on confirm_window
- remove print statements to console

Features to be added:
- CSV file with date/time, horizontal length, vertical length
- add button to shutdown the entire rasp pi
- Make individual files instead of all in touchscreen
